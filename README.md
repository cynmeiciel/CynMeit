# CynMeith - A Customizable Chess Engine

## Just a regular chess game, but with some tweaks.
After cooking some spaghetti that made me refuse to look at them again, I decided to write a brand new one, with my brand new brain.

**Practice makes perfect**
This might be quite overengineering with a bunch of design patterns and extra classes, but I think it is okay.

## Goals
This chess project is designed and expected to be easily configurable, modular and extendable, so that it can be a foundation for more complex chess games.
- **Modularity**: The game is designed to be modular, allowing for easy replacement or extension.
- **Configurability**: The game can be configured using external configuration files, making it easy to change the setup without modifying the code.
- **Extendability**: New rules, pieces, and features can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

# Task to do: Finish the engine, make it playable first, then implement chess, and then improve the performance last.
